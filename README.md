# JsonQL
A simple, lightweight implementation that leverages JSON files as databases. **CRUD** supported. The main reason for this solution is to implement database usage (or data storage) using JSON files as mediums. The library consists of some good queries that could be enacted to create databases, tables, insert data, update fields etc using filters as well.

## Usage
To use this library, include the JsonQL file into your project at the top thus;
```php
<?php
  include("./JsonQL/jsonql.php");
?>
```
